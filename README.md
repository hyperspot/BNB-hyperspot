## What is hyperspot?

Hyperspot is an Ethereum-based fixed-rate lending platform. A fixed interest rate is different from a variable or stable interest rate because the interest rate does not change over the term of the loan.

## What is the main role of hyperspot?

It will be a challenge for users to match and borrow against each other under exact conditions. Because of the huge liquidity pools, banks have traditionally acted as intermediaries with which borrowers and lenders interact - charging high fees. Hyperspot eliminates intermediaries and maintains on-chain liquidity pools that act as ready counterparties for individual users at any time.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Eliminate financial intermediaries through the Ethereum blockchain and provide secure and efficient fixed-rate loans to anyone in the world.
System integrity is ensured through strict risk management of protocol reserves and protocol governors. Hyperspot will be the safest place to earn fixed returns in DeFi.

## What we learned

Created a market for fixed-rate loans without intermediaries that can slash user returns. All users will be able to borrow at true, fair market prices and get the most value from their assets.
